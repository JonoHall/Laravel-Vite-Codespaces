## Step 1 - Clone Repository

Clone this repository and open a new Codespace instance with it.

## Step 2 - Wait for Installation

When your Codespace first boots it will install Laravel and configure itself to work with Codespaces. When the installation has completed the Codespace will need to be rebuilt, wait for the instruction to refesh your screen and you should be good to go!
